# .NET Modeling Framework (NMF)

This repository contains the entire code for the .NET Modeling Framework. The development of NMF started in about 2011 as a student project of Georg Hinkel. Since then, it has grown to a large development framework and multiple papers have been published on NMF. The source code used to be hosted under Codeplex but now has been migrated to Github.

## NuGet Packages
There is an outdated NuGet Package available. However, it is recommended to download the Code directly from the source repository.
